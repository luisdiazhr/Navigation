The agent receives a reward of +1 when collecting a yellow banana, and a reward of -1 for collecting a blue banana. Our goal is to train the agent to navigate and collect as many yellow bananas as possible. The task is episodic and the environment has a state space of 37 dimensions. Those correspond to data such as the agent's velocity and ray-based meaurements of the surrounding. The agent has a set of four available actions:

* 0: forward
* 1: backward
* 2: left
* 3: right

The goal of this project is to get the agent gets an average score of +13 over 100 consecutive episodes.
